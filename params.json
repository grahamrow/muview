{"name":"Muview","tagline":"OVF Compatible 3D Visualization for Micromagnetics","body":"### Muview\r\n\r\nMuView is an OVF (versions 1 and 2) compatible viewer intended to function with http://mumax.github.io/ and OOMMF. The viewer provides a fast QT/OpenGL interface that enables users to scrub through loaded files with an animation timeline, eliminating the need for manually generating image sequences and rendering animations using several third party software packages.\r\n\r\n### Current Features\r\n- Interactive 3D view of vector and scalar inputs (of arbitrary type)\r\n- Slicing for viewing cross-sections of the geometry\r\n- Easy scrubbing (with automatic caching) through loaded files\r\n- A folder may be watched such that Muview displays new files when they are created\r\n\r\nFiles may be loaded from command line using standard globbing\r\n```\r\nmuview SpinTorqueOscillator.out/m*.ovf\r\nmuview OOMMF-Data/Oxs*.omf\r\n```\r\nOtherwise, groups of files or entire directories can be loaded from the GUI.\r\n\r\n### Planned Features\r\n- Save image sequences and movies directly from the loaded set of files\r\n","google":"UA-47851689-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
