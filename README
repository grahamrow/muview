MuView will be the openGL based viewer for MuMax starting with version 2.

Strategy right now is to make a Qt-based GUI that will either:

a) Watch a directory for output (and allow the user to scrub through files)
b) Have the mumax code pull down current array values on the viewer's behalf. 

Choice (a) is quite easy, while (b) would require modifications of existing code. A hybrid approach could be to have mumax pull down the relevant arrays and store them to temporary files for viewing.
